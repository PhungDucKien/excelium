    If you are using Google Spreadsheets to write your tests, then when Jenkins
    try to access any test file, Excelium will ask for authentication.
    In a Jenkins environment, the console will output the authentication URL.
    You can access the URL from your computer to grant permission.

    Excelium supports <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts" target="_new">service account</a>
    to access your test files without asking your authentication. To use this feature, check this option and grant
    read/write permission on your test file to jenkins@excelium-2018.iam.gserviceaccount.com.
